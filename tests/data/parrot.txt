Many parrots can imitate human [[speech communication|speech]] or other sounds. A study by scientist [[Irene Pepperberg]] suggested a high learning ability in a grey parrot named [[Alex (parrot)|Alex]]. Alex was trained to use words to identify objects, describe them, count them, and even answer complex questions such as "How many red squares?" with over 80% accuracy.

Psittaciform diversity in South America and Australasia suggests that the [[order (biology)|order]] may have evolved in [[Gondwana]], centred in Australasia.<ref name="Wright" /> The scarcity of parrots in the fossil record, however, presents difficulties in confirming the hypothesis. There is currently a higher number of fossil remains from the northern hemisphere in the early Cenozoic.<ref name="Mayr, G. 2009">Mayr, G. (2009). Paleogene fossil birds. Springer.</ref> Molecular studies suggest that parrots evolved approximately 59 [[million years ago]] (Mya) (range 66–51&nbsp;Mya) in Gondwana. The [[Neotropical parrot|Neotropical Parrots]] are [[Monophyly|monophyletic]], and the three major clades originated about 50&nbsp;Mya (range 57–41&nbsp;Mya).<ref name="Tavares2006">{{cite journal|vauthors=Tavares ES, Baker AJ, Pereira SL, Miyaki CY |year=2006|title= Phylogenetic relationships and historical biogeography of neotropical parrots (Psittaciformes: Psittacidae: Arini) inferred from mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences|pmid=16861209|journal= Systematic Biology |volume=55|issue=3|pages=454–470|doi=10.1080/10635150600697390|doi-access=free}}</ref>

A single {{cvt|15|mm|in|1}} fragment from a large lower [[beak|bill]] ([[UCMP]] 143274), found in deposits from the [[Lance Creek Formation]] in [[Niobrara County, Wyoming]], had been thought to be the oldest parrot fossil and is presumed to have originated from the [[Late Cretaceous]] period, which makes it about 70&nbsp;million years old.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/23841 | last1 = Stidham | first1 = T. | year = 1998 | title = A lower jaw from a Cretaceous parrot | journal = Nature | volume = 396 | issue = 6706| pages = 29–30 | bibcode = 1998Natur.396...29S | s2cid = 204995638 | url = http://doc.rero.ch/record/14902/files/PAL_E2044.pdf }}</ref> However, other studies suggest that this fossil is not from a bird, but from a [[caenagnathid]] [[Oviraptorosauria|oviraptorosaur]] (a non-avian dinosaur with a birdlike beak), as several details of the fossil used to support its identity as a parrot are not actually exclusive to parrots, and it is dissimilar to the earliest-known unequivocal parrot fossils.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/20583 | last1 = Dyke | first1 = G.

It is generally assumed that the Psittaciformes were present during the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] (K-Pg extinction), 66 mya. They were probably generalised [[arboreal locomotion|arboreal]] birds, and did not have the specialised crushing bills of modern species.<ref name="Mayr, G. 2009"/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ksepka|first1=Daniel T.|last2=Clarke|first2=Julia A.|last3=Grande|first3=Lance|year=2011|title=Stem Parrots (Aves, Halcyornithidae) from the Green River Formation and a Combined Phylogeny of Pan-Psittaciformes|journal=Journal of Paleontology|volume=85|issue=5|pages=835–852|doi=10.1666/10-108.1|bibcode=2011JPal...85..835K |s2cid=86618579|issn=1937-2337}}</ref> Genomic analysis provides strong evidence that parrots are the [[sister group]] of [[passerine]]s, forming the clade [[Psittacopasserae]], which is the sister group of the [[Falconiformes|falcons]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Suh A, Paus M, Kiefmann M |title=Mesozoic retroposons reveal parrots as the closest living relatives of passerine birds |journal=Nature Communications |volume=2|pages=443–8 |year=2011 |pmid=21863010 |doi=10.1038/ncomms1448 |pmc=3265382 |issue=8 |bibcode=2011NatCo...2..443S  |last2=Paus |last3=Kiefmann |last4=Churakov |last5=Franke |last6=Brosius |last7=Kriegs |last8=Schmitz }}</ref>
